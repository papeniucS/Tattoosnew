                        have found a place in clinical settings. It has been suggested throughout the therapeutic

                    <hr>
                    <p>Many who have gotten tattooed speak upon how the process itself can provide a healing and
                        therapeutic experience. Perhaps it is the levels of endorphins released into the body from the
                        painful sensation, or maybe it’s the healing power of the art itself.</p>

                        many this has provided a deep sense of connectedness after a difficult loss.</p>
